//! UI-independent terminal sessions with bounded I/O and owned viewport contracts.
//!
//! A renderer acknowledges repaint before requesting [`TerminalSession::viewport`].
//! Backend state and mutex guards never cross this crate boundary. Grid resizing
//! happens before PTY notification; shutdown is nonblocking and remains observable
//! through [`ShutdownCompletion`] after the session handle is released.
