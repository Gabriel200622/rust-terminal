# Issue tracker: GitHub

Issues and specs for Pace live in [Gabriel200622/rust-terminal](https://github.com/Gabriel200622/rust-terminal/issues). Use the `gh` CLI.

Run commands inside this checkout, where `gh` infers the repository from `origin`. Outside the checkout, pass `--repo Gabriel200622/rust-terminal` to `gh issue` and `gh pr` commands. Use `repos/Gabriel200622/rust-terminal` for REST API paths.

## Conventions

- **Create an issue**: `gh issue create --title "..." --body-file <path>`.
- **Read an issue**: `gh issue view <number> --comments`. For structured metadata and labels, use `--json number,title,body,labels,comments,assignees,state`.
- **List issues**: `gh issue list --state open --limit 100 --json number,title,body,labels,comments,assignees`, with appropriate `--label` filters. Paginate with `gh api --paginate` when a complete inventory is required.
- **Comment**: `gh issue comment <number> --body-file <path>`.
- **Apply / remove labels**: `gh issue edit <number> --add-label "..."` / `--remove-label "..."`. Use the mapping in [triage-labels.md](triage-labels.md).
- **Close**: `gh issue close <number>`. If an explanation is needed, post it first using `gh issue comment --body-file`.

For multiline issue bodies, PR bodies and comments, write the exact Markdown to a temporary file and pass it with `--body-file`.

## Pull request delivery

For every change, including hotfixes:

1. Before committing, check `git branch --show-current`. If on `main` or another protected branch, create or switch to a feature branch first. Start new branches from `main` and preserve unrelated work.
2. Push only the feature branch with `git push --set-upstream origin <branch>`, then open a PR with `gh pr create --base main --head <branch> --title "..." --body-file <path>`.
3. Check CI for the latest PR head with `gh pr checks <number> --watch --fail-fast`. CI must be green before merge; pending, failed or cancelled checks block it. Repeat this check after any new commits.
4. Merge through the PR with `gh pr merge <number>` only after CI is green and branch protection requirements are satisfied. Do not use `--admin` to bypass these gates.

## Pull requests as a triage surface

Use issues for requests and specs; use PRs to deliver changes.

GitHub issues and PRs share a number space. Resolve an ambiguous number with `gh api repos/Gabriel200622/rust-terminal/issues/<number>`: a `pull_request` field identifies a PR. For an explicitly named PR, use `gh pr view <number> --comments` and `gh pr diff <number>`.

## When a skill says "publish to the issue tracker"

Create a GitHub issue.

## When a skill says "fetch the relevant ticket"

Run `gh issue view <number> --comments`.

## Wayfinding operations

Used by `/wayfinder`. The map is a single issue with child issues as tickets.

- **Map**: an issue labelled `wayfinder:map`, holding the Notes / Decisions-so-far / Fog body. Create it with `gh issue create --title "..." --label wayfinder:map --body-file <path>`.
- **Child ticket**: create an issue and link it as a GitHub sub-issue with `gh api --method POST repos/Gabriel200622/rust-terminal/issues/<map>/sub_issues -F sub_issue_id=<child-db-id>`. Obtain the numeric database id with `gh api repos/Gabriel200622/rust-terminal/issues/<child> --jq .id`. Where sub-issues are unavailable, add the child to an ordered task list in the map and put `Part of #<map>` at the top of the child body. Labels are `wayfinder:<type>` (`research`, `prototype`, `grilling`, or `task`).
- **Blocking**: use native issue dependencies with `gh api --method POST repos/Gabriel200622/rust-terminal/issues/<child>/dependencies/blocked_by -F issue_id=<blocker-db-id>`. Obtain the blocker's database id with `gh api repos/Gabriel200622/rust-terminal/issues/<blocker> --jq .id`; use the database id rather than the issue number or node id. If dependencies are unavailable, record `Blocked by: #<number>, #<number>` at the top of the child body. A ticket is unblocked when every blocker is closed.
- **Frontier query**: list the map's children with `gh api --paginate repos/Gabriel200622/rust-terminal/issues/<map>/sub_issues`, or read the fallback task list. Keep open, unassigned children. For each child, list blockers with `gh api --paginate repos/Gabriel200622/rust-terminal/issues/<child>/dependencies/blocked_by`, or read the fallback `Blocked by` line, and exclude children with an open blocker. The first remaining child in map order wins.
- **Claim**: `gh issue edit <number> --add-assignee @me`, the session's first write.
- **Resolve**: comment with `gh issue comment <number> --body-file <path>`, close the child, then append a context pointer (gist + link) to the map's Decisions-so-far using `gh issue edit <map> --body-file <path>`.
